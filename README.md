# blender-addons upgraded to blender 2.80

## Mocap tools

Updated the mocap tools to the blender version 2.8x.

Download available [Mocap Tools Blender 2.80](https://github.com/jlsneto/blender-addons/releases/download/mocap-28x/mocap.zip)

> Note: I don't guarantee full operation, because mocap tools has just been updated so that you can enable it on blender 2.80.
Some functionality may have problems. If so, [create an Issue](https://github.com/jlsneto/blender-addons/issues/new).
